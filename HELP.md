# URL Shortener API with Spring Boot and Jenkins CI/CD

This project is a classic backend service that provides a fully functional URL shortening API. It's built with Spring Boot and includes a complete Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline managed by Jenkins.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This application serves two main purposes:
1.  **Shorten URLs:** It accepts a long URL and returns a unique, 6-character short code.
2.  **Redirect URLs:** It accepts a short code and redirects the user to the original long URL.

The entire development process is managed using Agile principles, with tasks and user stories tracked on a GitHub Projects Kanban board.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **RESTful API:** Clean, simple endpoints for shortening and redirecting URLs.
-   **In-Memory Storage:** Uses a simple, thread-safe `ConcurrentHashMap` for high-speed lookups without needing a database.
-   **Automated CI Pipeline:** The `Jenkinsfile` defines a complete pipeline that automatically builds and tests the application on every code change.
-   **Unit Tested:** Includes comprehensive unit tests to ensure the reliability of both API endpoints.
